# smallballgames (Starter)

This is a very small static website (HTML/CSS/JS) meant to be easy to learn and expand.

## How to preview locally

- Easiest: double-click `index.html` to open in a browser.
- Better (serves files over HTTP): run one of these in the project folder:
  - Python: `python -m http.server 8000` → open http://localhost:8000
  - Node: `npx serve .` → open the shown URL

## What is in this project

- `index.html` — The front page with two big buttons: Games and Book Sports
- `styles.css` — Colors and layout (dark red and black theme)
- `games.html` — Placeholder Games page
- `book-sports.html` — Placeholder Book Sports page
- `script.js` — Small helpers and examples
- `AGENT.md` — Instructions for an agent to help you work on this project
- `DEPLOY.md` — Instructions for putting the site on a Synology NAS

## Branch & commit suggestion

- Create a branch: `agent/add-starters`
- Commit message example: `chore: add starter pages and styles`

If you'd like, I can run a local server for you or show the exact commands step-by-step.
